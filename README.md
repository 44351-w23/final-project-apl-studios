The project is just us following a 3D tutorial and then putting our own spin on it. 

The end goal for our project is that we are wanting to make a settings UI for the player and add in some more/different weapons to the game to give it our own kind of feel. 
Things may change and we may decide to go other routes to what we want to add so only time will tell.
